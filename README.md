# firebase-cows


## Description
This was our in-class project during our Data-Driven Apps phase in our NSS Front-End Bootcamp. 

Through this project, we learned to work with a REST API with a Firebase database as well as how to SMASH!! (aka, get data from multiple collections in Firebase) and why we should love the spread operator { ...XXXX }!
